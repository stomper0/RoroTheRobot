 - Colour sensor TCS34725 is not I2C addressable
 - Can't use two sensors concurrently
 - workarounds are:
	Different (addressable) I2C sensor (cost and time)
	Turn off each sensor to read the other (so many latecy and
	clock issues)
	Two Port Recieve (Basically the ability to turn each port
	off in software. Both can still report their colour but
	only one can be read at a time)

 - Moved on to developing PWM emitter for motors
 - H bridge uses jumpers which I obviously forgot at home
 - Using wire spares to connect Uno->H bridge->Wheels
 - Powering wheels by psu
 - Monitoring using serial USB
 - Both motors working between ~35 and 255 pwm vals
 - test fwd/bkwd H bridging tomorrow
 
 
MotorTestforPWMrange/MotorTestforPWMrange.ino compiles with wrong filename and uploader cant find it
